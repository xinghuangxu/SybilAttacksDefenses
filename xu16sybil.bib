abstract={Peer-to-peer and other decentralized, distributed systems are known to be particularly vulnerable to sybil attacks. In a sybil attack, a malicious user obtains multiple fake identities and pretends to be multiple, distinct nodes in the system. By controlling a large fraction of the nodes in the system, the malicious user is able to ldquoout voterdquo the honest users in collaborative tasks such as Byzantine failure defenses. This paper presents SybilGuard, a novel protocol for limiting the corruptive influences of sybil attacks. Our protocol is based on the ldquosocial networkrdquo among user identities, where an edge between two identities indicates a human-established trust relationship. Malicious users can create many identities but few trust relationships. Thus, there is a disproportionately small ldquocutrdquo in the graph between the sybil nodes and the honest nodes. SybilGuard exploits this property to bound the number of identities a malicious user can create. We show the effectiveness of SybilGuard both analytically and experimentally.},

@TechReport {danezis09sybilinfer,
abstract     = {<p>SybilInfer is an algorithm for labelling nodes in a social network as honest
                users or Sybils controlled by an adversary. At the heart of SybilInfer lies a
                probabilistic model of honest social networks, and an inference engine that
                returns potential regions of dishonest nodes. The Bayesian inference approach to
                Sybil detection comes with the advantage label has an assigned probability,
                indicating its degree of certainty. We prove through analytical results as well
                as experiments on simulated and real-world network topologies that, given
                standard constraints on the adversary, SybilInfer is secure, in that it
                successfully distinguishes between honest and dishonest nodes and is not
                susceptible to manipulation by the adversary. Furthermore, our results show that
                SybilInfer outperforms state of the art algorithms, both in being more widely
                applicable, as well as providing vastly more accurate results.</p>},
